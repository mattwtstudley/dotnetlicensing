# DotNetLicense

DotNetLicense is a library that can be used to create and validate RSA signed xml license files which you can use for licensing an application.
 It is based on the original code examples found at [http://www.dotnetlicensing.net](http://www.dotnetlicensing.net), but has a lot of additional work done to seperate the implementation of the license from
the business logic. 

## Quick Start this is another change! Hello there!

#####1. Include the library in your project:

`PM> Install-Package DotNetLicense`

#####2. Create a class in your project that represents your license.
 In your `get` and `set` methods, utilize the base.GetAttribute() and base.AddOrChangeAttribute() methods from the
    license class to register your attributes. The license will store everything as a string, so make sure to parse where appropriate. 

In the example below we have a sample license for the imaginary Northwind company. The license has three properties for ExpirationDate, NumberOfUsers, and LicensedTo:

```cs
using System;
using DotNetLicense;

namespace DotNetLicensing.Examples.Northwind.Models
{
    public class NorthwindLicense : License
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Creates a new Northwind license, unsigned. 
        /// </summary>
        public NorthwindLicense() : base()
        {
            //We make sure to intialize our values in the license so that we have base values. 
            this.ExpirationDate = DateTime.Now;
            this.LicensedTo = "";
            this.NumberOfUsers = 0;
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Constructs a NorthwindLicense based on the super-class license returned from DotNetLicense.LicenseManager
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="baseLicense"></param>
        public NorthwindLicense(License baseLicense) : base(baseLicense.ToXml())
        {
         
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// The date the license expires. 
        /// </summary>
        public DateTime ExpirationDate
        {
            get
            {
                return DateTime.Parse(base.GetAttribute("ExpirationDate"));
            }
            set
            {
                base.AddOrChangeAttribute("ExpirationDate", value.ToShortDateString());
            }
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// The person or organization the license was issued to.
        /// </summary>
        public string LicensedTo
        {
            get
            {
                return base.GetAttribute("LicensedTo");
            }
            set
            {
                base.AddOrChangeAttribute("LicensedTo", value);
            }
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// The number of users this license supports. 
        /// </summary>
        public int NumberOfUsers
        {
            get
            {
                return int.Parse(base.GetAttribute("NumberOfUsers"));
            }
            set
            {
                base.AddOrChangeAttribute("NumberOfUsers", value.ToString());
            }
        }
    }
}
```
#####3. Create a new key pair for generating and verifying licenses. 
In order to create a new license, you need to generate an RSA key-pair, which consists of a Private key and a Public key.   
- You use the private key to create a license and sign it. Keep this key secret, or anyone can make licenses. 
- You use a public key to verify the license and make sure it hasn't been changed. Your application will need this key to verify a license.  

Generating a new key pair is done with the `LicenseManager` object: 
```cs
    using DotNetLicense;
    var lm = new LicenseManager();
    lm.CreateKeyPairs("Path\\To\\Folder", "newKeyPair");
`

This generates two .key files in the directory provided in the first argument. They will have the name given in the second argument, with _private.key
 and \_public.key appended to them. In the example above, you would get newKeyPair\_private.key and newKeyPair\_public.key. 


#####4. Create and sign a new license.

Using the _private_ key you made in step 3, you can then use your license class and the license manager to create a new license: 


```cs

    NorthwindLicense newLicense = new NorthwindLicense();
    license.LicensedTo = "HelloWorld Inc."
    license.ExpirationDate = DateTime.Now().AddDays(30);
    license.NumberOfUsers = 30;    

    LicenseManager lm = new LicenseManager();
    lm.LoadPrivateKeyFromFile("Path\To\Private.Key");

    lm.SignAndSaveNewLicense(newLicense, "Path\For\New\License.lic");
`

This generates a license that is signed with the RSA key pair. You can send this license to the end user or otherwise use your license. 


#####5. Load and check your license. 


On the application that is being licensed, you load the license using the _public_ key from your keypair. You'll need to bundle or otherwise
have the public key available to end-user-applications. That's why its called public! 

Use the license manager to load your public key, and then your license: 


```cs
    LicenseManager manager = new LicenseManager();
    manager.LoadPublicKeyFromFile("Path\To\Public.key");
    NorthwindLicense myLicense;
    
    try
    {
        License baseLicense = manager.LoadLicenseFromDisk("Path\To\License.lic");
        myLicense = new NorthwindLicense(baseLicense);
    }
    catch (LicenseVerificationException licenseEx)
    {
        //Malformed xml, or someone change the file and the signature is failing. 
    }
`

You should always handle the LicenseVerificationException if it is thrown, as that indicates the license was changed or
the license was invalid (wrong file etc...)

#####6. Implement the rest of your business logic. 

Once you've got your custom license object succesfully loaded, you can check for number of users / expiration date as needed using C# 
native objects and not worry about strings. That's pretty much it!
